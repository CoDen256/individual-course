  execution:
    - Compiler, Assembler, CPU
    - VM
    - Source code vs Bytecode vs machine code vs assembly code
    - JVM, Java compiler
    -
  variables:
    - values, statements
    - immutability, mutability
    - pass by reference, pass by value
  primitive types:
    - int, bool, float
  execution phases:
    - static, dynamic
    - compile time, runtime
    - syntax error, compile error, runtime error
    - order of initializing
  structure:
    - flow of control
    - visibility:
        - block, method, control flow, class
        - static vs dynamic visibility
    - order of execution

  classes:
    - methods
    - objects
    - static methods
    - type

  methods:
    - input, output, blackbox
    - sideeffects, pure functions
    - function composition
    - operators
  types:
    - polymorphism
    - values
    - references
    - software design
    - abstraction
  refactoring:
    - extracting variables
    - functions
    - structure
    - extracting input and output
    - diving big into small
  testing:
    - unit tests
