<h1>Questions</h1>

The quiz is nearly impossible to make using intellij framework
so I made my own quiz framework. A little bit complicated but better than nothing.

- You will be given multiple questions that you have to answer in order to pass this task
- Open [Answers](file://execution/execution-questions/src/Answers.java)
- Put your answers in the values of the variables.
- Run 'Check,' verify in the test results, what questions you have answered incorrectly.



<h2> A. What is the output, when 'ToBeCompiled' is run? </h2>
<h2> B. What instruction (from bytecode) corresponds to adding two numbers?</h2>
Inspect the source code along with the disassembled bytecode.
<h2> C. What is the name of the variable in the decompiled that corresponds to variable 'b' in .java</h2>
Examine. ToBeCompiled.java and decompiled by Jetbrains ToBeCompiled.class. 
<h2> D. What do you think is better? Catch error on compile time or runtime? </h2>
