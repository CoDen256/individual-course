<h1>Questions</h1>

The quiz is nearly impossible to make using intellij framework
so I made my own quiz framework. A little bit complicated but better than nothing.

- You will be given multiple questions that you have to answer in order to pass this task
- Open [Answers](file://execution/execution-questions/src/Answers.java)
- Put your answers as string values to the corresponding question name [i.e. 'A', 'B'].
- Run 'Check,' verify in the test results, what questions you have answered incorrectly.
- For single choices, enter the number of the choice. '1'
- For multiple choices, enter the number divided by comma '1,2'

``` 
class Answers{
    String A = "YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE FOR QUESTION A"
    String B = "..." 
    String C = "3" // For multiple choices i pick 3rd choice
    ...
}
```


<h2> A.
Compiler converts ... <br>
</h2>

1. assembly code to machine code
2. machine code to execution of the code
3. source code to machine code
4. assembly code to bytecode

<h2> B.
JVM is a...</h2>

1. compiler
2. type of cpu 
3. interpreter
4. assembler
5. "virtual cpu"


<h2> C. JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE takes as an input ... </h2>

1. C source code
2. Actual binary machine code
3. JAVA source code
4. Bytecode

<h2> D. CPU can run... </h2>

1. C source code
2. Actual binary machine code
3. JAVA source code
4. Bytecode


<h2> E. Imagine...
</h2>

- I have ARM CPU. I have JVM on my machine with this ARM CPU
- I have a friend with x86 CPU machine and JVM on his machine
- I give him "[insert answer from previous question C] code" that I compiled on my machine
- Will he able to run it on his JVM?
- Assume the JVMs have the same version

1. Yep
2. Nope

<h2> F. Given just the java source code. It can be run even if you don't have JVM</h2>

1. Yep
2. Nope

<h2> G. Given just the java source code AND JVM. It can be run if you don't have java compiler</h2>

1. Yep
2. Nope

<h2> H. Given just bytecode and JVM. It can be run even if you don't have a java compiler</h2>

1. Yep
2. Nope

<h2> I. Given just bytecode and Java compiler. It can be run even if you don't have a JVM</h2>

1. Yep
2. Nope

<h2> J. Python </h2>
I give you a python script. And I want to run it on my CPU. 
What you would need in theory to be able to run it. 
Multiple answers allowed.

1. Assembler
2. Compiler
3. Virtual Machine is enough
4. Virtual Machine and a compiler for that VM

<h2> K. Java compiler produces</h2>

1. Assembly code
2. Source code
3. Machine code
4. Bytecode
